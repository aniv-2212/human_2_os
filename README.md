# Human OS v2.0.27

**Human OS** is a futuristic dashboard designed to visualize and optimize human potential using AI-driven insights. It serves as a "Digital Twin" interface, analyzing biometric data, skill matrices, and career trajectories to provide actionable growth recommendations.

## 🚀 Features

*   **Digital Twin Profile**: visualizes "Skill Dominance" and core drivers.
*   **AI Insight Engine**: Proactive growth suggestions based on neural architecture analysis.
*   **Horizon Forecasting**: Probabilistic career trajectory prediction.
*   **Decision Simulator**: Compare life paths (e.g., Path A vs. Path B) with an Intrinsic Motivation Index.
*   **Interactive Calibration**: "Neural Initialization" protocol to train the model with custom user data.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

*   **Backend**: Python 3.13+, Flask
*   **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3 (Responsive Cyberpunk UI)
*   **Architecture**: Modular (Core Engines separated from Interface)
